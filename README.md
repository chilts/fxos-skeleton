# Skeleton App for Firefox OS #

This skeleton app consists of the following:

* a totally empty `manifest.webapp`
* a fairly empty `index.html`
* the following folders from https://github.com/buildingfirefoxos/Building-Blocks directories inside `assets/`:
** `style/`
** `style_unstable/`
** `icons/`
** `fonts/`

At the moment, that is the only plan, but we may add some examples too.
