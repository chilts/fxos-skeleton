# Skeleton App for Firefox OS #

This skeleton app consists of the following:

* a totally empty `manifest.webapp`
* a fairly empty `index.html`
* the `style/` and `style_unstable/` from https://github.com/buildingfirefoxos/Building-Blocks directories merged into the `assets/` directory

At the moment, that is the only plan, but we may add some examples too.
